# BankReport

General Description
BankReport is a cross-platform mobile application built with Xamarin, targeting both Android and iOS platforms. The solution is organized into separate projects for shared code, Android, and iOS implementations.
This application receives transaction/balance/account information from various banking sources, processes it, and sends it to users or administrators as scheduled or event-based reports via SMS. Purpose: Automate financial reporting in environments where SMS is the best method of notification.

## Efficiency

BankReport is designed with efficiency in mind to ensure smooth performance on both Android and iOS devices:

- **Optimized Data Handling:** Uses efficient data structures and minimizes memory usage for better responsiveness.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Implements async/await patterns for network and database operations to keep the UI responsive.
- **Resource Management:** Loads images and resources on demand and disposes of unused objects to reduce memory footprint.
- **Platform-Specific Optimizations:** Leverages Xamarinâ€™s platform-specific APIs for optimal performance on each device.
- **MVVM Architecture:** Separates UI and business logic for maintainable and efficient code.

For best results, keep your development environment and dependencies up to date, and test on real devices regularly.
